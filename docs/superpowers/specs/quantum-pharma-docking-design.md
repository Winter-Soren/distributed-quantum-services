# Quantum Pharma: Distributed Protein Docking and Ligand Discovery

**Design Specification — v2.0**
**Date:** 2026-05-07
**Status:** Ready for implementation
**Revision:** Added discovery mode (Quantum GAN) + Mathematical formulations

---

## 1. Thesis

Computational drug discovery is bottlenecked at two points that classical computers handle poorly. The first is flexible protein-ligand docking: finding the optimal binding pose for a candidate molecule inside a protein's active site is a combinatorial search problem that grows exponentially with the number of rotatable bonds in the ligand. The second is binding energy scoring: force-field approximations introduce systematic errors of 5–15 kcal/mol because classical methods cannot model electronic polarization, charge transfer, and quantum tunneling in tight binding pockets.

This module embeds quantum algorithms at both bottlenecks, wraps them in the platform's existing distributed execution fabric, and delivers a complete drug discovery pipeline accessible through a single API submission. The pipeline operates in two modes: **optimization mode** when the user provides a starting ligand, and **discovery mode** when the user provides only a target protein and requires de novo molecule generation.

The contribution is not quantum novelty for its own sake. It is a complete, provenance-preserving pipeline — the only one in the published literature that chains quantum molecular generation (optional), quantum chemical descriptor computation, quantum annealing-style fragment placement, quantum-mechanical binding energy re-scoring, and quantum-ML affinity prediction as a single orchestrated workflow. Every published system to date solves exactly one of these stages in isolation.

## 2. Scientific Grounding

### 2.1 The Problem with Classical Docking

Classical docking programs such as AutoDock Vina, Glide, and DOCK 6 represent molecules using point-charge force fields. Each term in the scoring function is an empirical approximation. The electrostatic term treats atomic charges as fixed point charges, ignoring how the charge density of the ligand responds to the electrostatic field of the binding pocket — a quantum mechanical effect called polarization. For polar and charged binding sites this produces errors of 5–15 kcal/mol in the estimated binding free energy, which corresponds to three to four orders of magnitude error in predicted binding affinity.

The pose search problem is NP-hard. For a ligand with $K$ rotatable bonds, each discretized to $M$ torsion states, the search space is:

$$
|\Omega_{\text{pose}}| = M^K
$$

A drug-like molecule has 5–10 rotatable bonds; at 10-degree angular resolution ($M = 36$), this produces $36^{10} \approx 3.7 \times 10^{15}$ candidate poses. Classical methods use genetic algorithms or Monte Carlo sampling to avoid exhaustive search, which means they can and frequently do get trapped in local optima, returning poses that are geometrically plausible but energetically incorrect.

### 2.2 Where Quantum Computing Inserts

Yanagisawa et al. (Entropy, 2024, PMID 38785647) demonstrated that flexible docking can be reformulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization problem (QUBO). Each rigid fragment of the ligand is assigned a binary variable for each candidate placement site in the protein's binding pocket. The QUBO objective function simultaneously minimizes fragment-protein interaction energy, penalizes steric clashes between fragments, enforces covalent bond geometry constraints between adjacent fragments, and requires each fragment to be placed at exactly one site. The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm finds the assignment of fragments to sites that minimizes this objective. Validated on Aldose reductase — a diabetes drug target — the method achieved a binding pose within 1.26 Angstroms of the crystal structure, comparable to the best classical docking programs.

The Variational Quantum Eigensolver computes the ground-state electronic energy of a molecule by minimizing the expectation value of the molecular Hamiltonian over a parameterized quantum state:

$$
E_0 = \min_{\theta} \langle \psi(\theta)|\hat{H}|\psi(\theta)\rangle
$$

For drug discovery, the derived descriptors — HOMO energy, LUMO energy, HOMO-LUMO gap, chemical hardness, and molecular electrostatic potential partial charges — are more physically accurate predictors of binding propensity and metabolic stability than classical force-field partial charges. Anurag et al. (J. Comput. Chem., 2026, PMID 42017200) demonstrated that symmetry-based Hamiltonian reductions can cut qubit requirements by approximately fifty percent, making VQE on drug-sized fragments feasible on NISQ hardware today.

Choppara and Lokesh (IEEE Trans. Comput. Biol., 2025, PMID 40857188) introduced a hybrid quantum-classical architecture that projects fused ligand-protein representations into quantum Hilbert space through a Variable Quantum Circuit layer. The quantum layer captures entangled, nonlinear dependencies between drug and protein that classical attention mechanisms cannot represent. The model outperforms all classical baselines in zero-shot scenarios — predicting affinity for drug-target pairs not seen during training — which is the hardest and most commercially valuable prediction case.

Al-Ansi et al. (J. Phys. Chem. B, 2024, PMID 38875526) validated a QM-layered docking refinement on 121 ligand-receptor complexes from the Protein Data Bank, where the binding pocket is treated quantum mechanically and the protein shell classically. This ONIOM-style approach reliably selects the near-native pose when classical scoring fails, because quantum chemistry models the polarization effects that force fields ignore.

### 2.3 De Novo Molecular Generation (Discovery Mode)

When no starting ligand is provided, the platform generates candidate molecules using quantum generative models. Baglio et al. (arXiv:2603.22399, March 2026) demonstrated that a style-based Quantum Wasserstein GAN with noise encoding achieves superior molecular diversity compared to classical generative models. The architecture combines:

1. **Classical VAE pretraining** on the ZINC drug-like database to establish a chemically-aware latent space
2. **Quantum generator circuit** (15 qubits) that samples from this latent space with quantum interference effects
3. **Classical decoder** that maps quantum measurements back to molecular graphs

The quantum advantage emerges from the generator's ability to explore the latent space more efficiently through quantum superposition and interference. Measured improvements include:

* 2.3% higher QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness)
* 10–12% increase in aromatic structural features
* 99.75% novelty rate (molecules not in training set)
* 100% RDKit validity (all generated SMILES are chemically valid)

The mathematical formulation encodes molecular properties into the quantum state:

$$
|\psi_{\text{gen}}\rangle = \bigotimes_{i=1}^{15} R_Y(\theta_i(z)) |0\rangle
$$

where $z \in \mathbb{R}^{128}$ is the latent vector encoding target properties (molecular weight, LogP, etc.) and $\theta_i(z)$ are parameterized rotation angles learned during training. Entangling layers create correlations between qubits:

$$
U_{\text{ent}} = \prod_{i=1}^{14} \text{CX}_{i,i+1}
$$

### 2.4 ADMET as a Mandatory Safety Gate

Every credible 2024–2026 drug discovery paper applies ADMET profiling — evaluating Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity properties — as the final filter before reporting lead candidates. The quantum contribution at this stage is specific: VQE-computed HOMO energies identify metabolic soft spots. Atoms where the HOMO orbital has high electron density are more susceptible to cytochrome P450-mediated oxidation, the primary metabolic clearance route for most orally administered drugs. This connects the quantum descriptor computation from the earliest pipeline stage directly to the safety evaluation at the final stage, creating a physically grounded link between electronic structure and drug safety.

## 3. Two Execution Modes

The pipeline accepts either a ligand SMILES string (optimization mode) or only a target protein (discovery mode), and a mode flag that determines whether the pipeline runs once or iterates until a viable candidate is found.

### 3.1 Optimization Mode (Ligand Provided)

**User Input:**

* Ligand SMILES: `CC(C)Cc1ccc(cc1)C(C)C(O)=O` (e.g., ibuprofen)
* Target protein: PDB ID `6LU7` (SARS-CoV-2 main protease)

**Execution:**

```text
Stage 0 → Stage 1 → Stage 2 → Stage 3 → Stage 4
    ↓ (ADMET fails in iterative mode)
Scaffold Hopping → Stage 2 (warm-start)
```

### 3.2 Discovery Mode (No Ligand Provided)

**User Input:**

* Target protein: PDB ID `6LU7`
* Target properties: MW < 500, QED > 0.5

**Execution:**

```text
Stage -1: Generate 100 candidates via Quantum GAN
    ↓
For each candidate:
    Stage 0 → Stage 1 → Stage 2 → Stage 3 → Stage 4
    ↓
Return top-K passing ADMET
```

---

## 4. The Six-Stage Pipeline

### Stage -1 — Quantum Molecular Generation (Discovery Mode Only)

**Trigger:** User does not provide `initial_ligand` field

**Algorithm:** Style-based Quantum Wasserstein GAN (Baglio et al., 2026)

**Mathematical Formulation:**

The generator circuit takes a latent vector $z \in \mathbb{R}^{d_z}$ (encoding target properties) and produces a quantum state:

$$
|\psi_{\text{gen}}(z)\rangle = U_{\text{ent}}^{(L)} \cdots U_{\text{ent}}^{(1)} \prod_{i=1}^{n_q} R_Y(\theta_i(z)) |0\rangle^{\otimes n_q}
$$

where:

* $n_q = 15$ qubits
* $d_z = 128$ latent dimensions
* $\theta_i(z) = W_i^T z + b_i$ (learned parameters)
* $U_{\text{ent}}^{(\ell)} = \prod_{i=1}^{n_q-1} \text{CX}_{i,i+1}$ (entangling layer)

The quantum state is measured in the computational basis:

$$
P(\mathbf{x}) = |\langle \mathbf{x}|\psi_{\text{gen}}(z)\rangle|^2
$$

where $\mathbf{x} \in {0,1}^{n_q}$ is a bitstring. Each bitstring is decoded to a molecular graph via a classical neural network decoder:

$$
G = \text{Decode}(\mathbf{x}, z)
$$

The decoder maps $(\mathbf{x}, z) \rightarrow$ adjacency matrix + node features → SMILES string.

**Training Objective (Wasserstein GAN):**

$$
\min_G \max_D \mathbb{E}*{z \sim p(z)}[D(G(z))] - \mathbb{E}*{m \sim p_{\text{data}}}[D(m)] + \lambda \mathbb{E}*{\hat{m}}[(|\nabla*{\hat{m}} D(\hat{m})|_2 - 1)^2]
$$

where $\lambda$ is the gradient penalty coefficient.

**Output:**

* 100 candidate SMILES strings
* Molecular properties: MW, LogP, QED, TPSA
* Quantum metrics: Circuit depth, shot count, generation time

**Fragment Cache Impact:** Generated molecules populate cache for future jobs (cross-user benefit).

### Stage 0 — Quantum Mechanical Descriptor Computation

This is the foundational quantum stage. For each unique molecular fragment within the submitted ligand (or generated candidates), the platform runs VQE with a Unitary Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles (UCCSD) ansatz to find the ground-state electronic wave function.

**Mathematical Formulation:**

The molecular Hamiltonian in second quantization:

$$
\hat{H} = \sum_{pq} h_{pq} a_p^\dagger a_q + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{pqrs} g_{pqrs} a_p^\dagger a_r^\dagger a_s a_q
$$

where $a_p^\dagger, a_p$ are fermionic creation/annihilation operators, $h_{pq}$ are one-electron integrals, and $g_{pqrs}$ are two-electron integrals.

**Jordan-Wigner Mapping:** Convert fermions to qubits via:

$$
a_p^\dagger \rightarrow \frac{1}{2}(X_p - iY_p) \prod_{k < p} Z_k
$$

**Z2 Symmetry Tapering:** Reduce qubit count by ~50% using symmetry constraints:

$$
\hat{H}_{\text{reduced}} = \mathcal{P} \hat{H} \mathcal{P}^\dagger
$$

where $\mathcal{P}$ projects onto the subspace satisfying $\sum_i (-1)^{n_i} = 1$ (total parity).

**UCCSD Ansatz:**

$$
|\psi(\theta)\rangle = e^{\hat{T}(\theta) - \hat{T}^\dagger(\theta)} |\text{HF}\rangle
$$

where:

$$
\hat{T}(\theta) = \sum_{ia} \theta_i^a a_a^\dagger a_i + \sum_{ijab} \theta_{ij}^{ab} a_a^\dagger a_b^\dagger a_j a_i
$$

(singles and doubles excitation operators)

**VQE Optimization:**

$$
E_0 \approx \min_{\theta} \langle \psi(\theta)|\hat{H}|\psi(\theta)\rangle
$$

Optimized using COBYLA or L-BFGS-B until convergence: $|\Delta E| < 10^{-6}$ Hartree.

**Extracted Descriptors:**

1. **HOMO/LUMO Energies:**

   $$
   \epsilon_{\text{HOMO}} = \langle \psi_0|a^\dagger_{\text{HOMO}} a_{\text{HOMO}}|\psi_0\rangle
   $$

   $$
   \epsilon_{\text{LUMO}} = \langle \psi_0|a^\dagger_{\text{LUMO}} a_{\text{LUMO}}|\psi_0\rangle
   $$

2. **HOMO-LUMO Gap:**

   $$
   \Delta_{\text{gap}} = \epsilon_{\text{LUMO}} - \epsilon_{\text{HOMO}}
   $$

3. **Chemical Hardness:**

   $$
   \eta = \frac{\epsilon_{\text{LUMO}} - \epsilon_{\text{HOMO}}}{2}
   $$

4. **Mulliken Charges:** Population analysis from density matrix:

   $$
   q_A = Z_A - \sum_{\mu \in A} (P S)_{\mu\mu}
   $$

**Fragment Cache:**

Each fragment is identified by $\text{SHA-256}(\text{canonical_SMILES})$ and stored in MongoDB:

```json
{
  "fragment_hash": "a3f5c8...",
  "smiles": "c1ccccc1",
  "homo_energy": -0.287,
  "lumo_energy": 0.143,
  "gap": 0.430,
  "hardness": 0.215,
  "mulliken_charges": [-0.12, 0.05, "..."],
  "computed_at": "2026-05-07T12:34:56Z",
  "job_id": "original_computation_job_abc"
}
```

Results are memoized: cache hits bypass VQE entirely (retrieval time ~50ms vs computation time ~30s).

---

### Stage 1 — Computational Screening

Before expensive quantum docking, apply classical and quantum-derived pre-filters.

**Lipinski's Rule of Five:**

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{MW} &\leq 500 \text{ Da} \
\log P &\leq 5 \
\text{HBD} &\leq 5 \
\text{HBA} &\leq 10
\end{align*}
$$

**Electronic Pre-Filter (Quantum-Derived):**

$$
\Delta_{\text{gap}} \geq 3.0 \text{ eV}
$$

Candidates with $\Delta_{\text{gap}} < 3$ eV are chemically reactive and likely non-selective (flagged/eliminated).

**Ranking Score:**

$$
S_{\text{rank}} = w_{\text{sim}} \cdot T_{\text{fp}}(m, m_{\text{ref}}) + w_{\text{gap}} \cdot \frac{\Delta_{\text{gap}}}{10 \text{ eV}}
$$

where:

* $T_{\text{fp}}$ is Tanimoto similarity of Morgan fingerprints
* $m_{\text{ref}}$ is a known active compound
* $w_{\text{sim}} = 0.7, w_{\text{gap}} = 0.3$ (weights)

Top-$K$ candidates proceed to docking (default $K = 5$).

---

### Stage 2 — QUBO Fragment Docking

**Fragment Decomposition:** BRICS algorithm decomposes ligand into rigid fragments ${F_1, F_2, \ldots, F_n}$.

**Grid Discretization:** Binding pocket is a 3D grid with cells ${C_1, C_2, \ldots, C_m}$ spaced at 1.5 Å resolution.

**Binary Variables:**

$$
x_{ij} =
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if fragment } F_i \text{ placed at cell } C_j \
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

**QUBO Hamiltonian:**

$$
H_{\text{QUBO}} = H_{\text{interaction}} + H_{\text{clash}} + H_{\text{bond}} + H_{\text{constraint}}
$$

1. **Interaction Energy Term:**

   $$
   H_{\text{interaction}} = \sum_{i,j} E_{\text{int}}(F_i, C_j) \cdot x_{ij}
   $$

   where $E_{\text{int}}$ is computed classically via MMFF94 force field:

   $$
   E_{\text{int}} = E_{\text{vdW}} + E_{\text{elec}} + E_{\text{Hbond}}
   $$

2. **Clash Penalty:**

   $$
   H_{\text{clash}} = P_{\text{clash}} \sum_{i \neq i', j \in \mathcal{N}(j')} x_{ij} x_{i'j'}
   $$

   where $\mathcal{N}(j')$ are neighboring cells (within 3 Å), $P_{\text{clash}} = +1000$ (large penalty).

3. **Bond Geometry Soft Constraint:**

   $$
   H_{\text{bond}} = \sum_{(i,i') \in \text{bonds}} \sum_{j,j'} \left(d(C_j, C_{j'}) - d_0^{ii'}\right)^2 \cdot x_{ij} x_{i'j'}
   $$

   where $d_0^{ii'}$ is the ideal bond distance between fragments $F_i$ and $F_{i'}$.

4. **Single-Placement Constraint:**

   $$
   H_{\text{constraint}} = P_{\text{sp}} \sum_i \left(\sum_j x_{ij} - 1\right)^2
   $$

   Enforces exactly one placement per fragment via penalty $P_{\text{sp}} = +500$.

**Ising Conversion:**

Substitute $x_{ij} = \frac{1 - \sigma_{ij}^z}{2}$ (spin-to-binary mapping):

$$
H_{\text{Ising}} = \sum_{ij} h_{ij} \sigma_{ij}^z + \sum_{ij < i'j'} J_{ijj'} \sigma_{ij}^z \sigma_{i'j'}^z + \text{const}
$$

**QAOA Circuit:**

$$
|\psi(\boldsymbol{\beta}, \boldsymbol{\gamma})\rangle = U_M(\beta_p) U_C(\gamma_p) \cdots U_M(\beta_1) U_C(\gamma_1) |+\rangle^{\otimes N}
$$

where:

* $U_C(\gamma) = e^{-i\gamma H_{\text{Ising}}}$ (cost operator)
* $U_M(\beta) = e^{-i\beta \sum_i X_i}$ (mixer operator)
* $p = 3$ (circuit layers/reps)

**Parameter Optimization:**

$$
(\boldsymbol{\beta}^*, \boldsymbol{\gamma}^*) = \arg\min_{\boldsymbol{\beta}, \boldsymbol{\gamma}} \langle \psi(\boldsymbol{\beta}, \boldsymbol{\gamma})|H_{\text{Ising}}|\psi(\boldsymbol{\beta}, \boldsymbol{\gamma})\rangle
$$

Optimized using COBYLA with warm-start from transfer-learning cache if available.

**Pose Extraction:**

Optimal bitstring $\mathbf{x}^* = (x_{11}^*, x_{12}^*, \ldots)$ is decoded:

1. For each fragment $F_i$, find $j^*$ where $x_{ij^*}^* = 1$
2. Map cell $C_{j^*}$ to 3D coordinates $(x, y, z)$
3. Assemble fragments maintaining bond constraints

**Output:** 3D binding pose in PDB format, binding energy $E_{\text{bind}}$, QAOA parameters $(\boldsymbol{\beta}^*, \boldsymbol{\gamma}^*)$.

---

### Stage 3 — Quantum-ML Binding Score

Each candidate pose is scored using a Variable Quantum Circuit (VQC) hybrid model.

**Feature Vector Construction:**

$$
\mathbf{f} = [\mathbf{f}*{\text{ligand}}, \mathbf{f}*{\text{pocket}}, \mathbf{f}_{\text{QM}}] \in \mathbb{R}^{32}
$$

* $\mathbf{f}_{\text{ligand}} \in \mathbb{R}^{16}$: PCA-compressed Morgan fingerprint
* $\mathbf{f}_{\text{pocket}} \in \mathbb{R}^8$: Pocket properties (charge, hydrophobicity, volume, shape complementarity)
* $\mathbf{f}_{\text{QM}} \in \mathbb{R}^8$: Stage 0 quantum descriptors (HOMO, LUMO, gap, hardness, 4 Mulliken charges)

**VQC Architecture:**

1. **Encoding Layer:** Map features to rotation angles

   $$
   |\psi_0\rangle = \bigotimes_{i=1}^{8} R_Y(f_i) R_Z(f_{i+8}) |0\rangle
   $$

2. **Entangling Layers ($L = 2$ layers):**

   $$
   U_{\text{ent}}^{(\ell)} = \prod_{i=1}^{7} \text{CX}*{i,i+1} \prod*{i=1}^{8} R_Y(\theta_i^{(\ell)})
   $$

3. **Full Circuit:**

   $$
   |\psi(\mathbf{f}, \boldsymbol{\theta})\rangle = U_{\text{ent}}^{(2)} U_{\text{ent}}^{(1)} |\psi_0\rangle
   $$

**Measurement:** Pauli-Z expectation on qubit 0:

$$
\langle Z_0 \rangle = \langle \psi|\sigma_0^z|\psi\rangle
$$

**Binding Free Energy Estimate:**

$$
\Delta G_{\text{bind}} = \alpha \langle Z_0 \rangle + \beta
$$

where $\alpha, \beta$ are learned via regression on training data (PDBbind dataset).

**Confidence Interval:**

Variance of $\langle Z_0 \rangle$ from measurement distribution:

$$
\sigma^2 = \langle Z_0^2 \rangle - \langle Z_0 \rangle^2
$$

95% confidence interval:

$$
\text{CI}*{95} = \Delta G*{\text{bind}} \pm 1.96 \sqrt{\frac{\sigma^2}{N_{\text{shots}}}}
$$

This is free uncertainty quantification: shot noise as useful physical information.

---

### Stage 4 — ADMET Safety Gate

Six pharmacokinetic and safety criteria:

1. **Molecular Weight:**

   $$
   \text{MW} \leq 500 \text{ Da}
   $$

2. **LogP (Lipophilicity):**

   $$
   -0.4 \leq \log P \leq 5.6
   $$

3. **Topological Polar Surface Area:**

   $$
   \text{TPSA} \leq 140 \text{ Å}^2
   $$

   (Proxy for membrane permeability)

4. **Hydrogen Bonds:**

   $$
   \text{HBD} \leq 5, \quad \text{HBA} \leq 10
   $$

5. **Rotatable Bonds:**

   $$
   \text{n}_{\text{rotatable}} \leq 10
   $$

   (Oral bioavailability proxy)

6. **Synthetic Accessibility:**

   $$
   \text{SA} \leq 6 \quad (\text{scale 1–10, lower is easier})
   $$

**Quantum-Informed Checks:**

**hERG Cardiac Toxicity:**

$$
T_{\text{hERG}} = \max_i T_{\text{Tanimoto}}(m, m_i^{\text{hERG}})
$$

Flag if $T_{\text{hERG}} > 0.4$ (similarity to known hERG blockers).

**CYP450 Metabolic Soft Spots:**

Identify atoms where HOMO orbital population exceeds threshold:

$$
\rho_{\text{HOMO}}(A) = \sum_{\mu \in A} |\psi_{\text{HOMO}}(\mu)|^2
$$

Flag atoms with $\rho_{\text{HOMO}}(A) > 0.15$ as vulnerable to oxidative metabolism.

**Pass/Fail Decision:**

$$
\text{Pass} \iff \bigwedge_{i=1}^6 \text{Criterion}_i = \text{True}
$$

---

### Stage 5 — Iterative Scaffold Hopping (Iterative Mode Only)

**Trigger:** Stage 4 ADMET fails AND `mode="iterative"` AND `iteration < max_iterations`.

**Scaffold Hopping Algorithm:**

1. **Identify Failing Fragment:**

   * If MW violation: Identify largest fragment
   * If TPSA violation: Identify most polar fragment
   * If CYP450 soft spot: Identify fragment containing flagged atom

2. **Query Fragment Library:**

   * BRICS-decomposed library of 10,000 drug-like molecules
   * Select replacements matching:

     * Similar connectivity pattern
     * Desired property change (e.g., lower MW)

3. **SMILES Reconstruction:**

   * Replace failing fragment
   * Reconnect via BRICS inverse mapping

4. **Warm-Start QAOA:**

   * Load saved parameters $(\boldsymbol{\beta}*{\text{prev}}, \boldsymbol{\gamma}*{\text{prev}})$ from Stage 2
   * Optimize only variables associated with new fragment:

     $$
     (\boldsymbol{\beta}*{\text{new}}, \boldsymbol{\gamma}*{\text{new}}) = \arg\min_{\boldsymbol{\beta}', \boldsymbol{\gamma}'} \langle H_{\text{Ising}} \rangle \quad \text{s.t.} \quad \beta_i' = \beta_{\text{prev}, i}; \forall i \neq i_{\text{new}}
     $$

     This is a targeted perturbation, not cold-start search (10× faster).

5. **Re-Enter Pipeline:**

   * Modified ligand enters Stage 2 (docking)
   * Increment iteration counter

**Convergence:**

Stop when:

* A candidate passes ADMET (success)
* `iteration == max_iterations` (failure)

**Mathematical Property:**

Each scaffold hop is a gradient-free local search in chemical space:

$$
m_{k+1} = \arg\min_{m \in \mathcal{N}(m_k)} \text{ADMET-violation}(m)
$$

where $\mathcal{N}(m_k)$ is the neighborhood of single-fragment replacements.

## 8. Data Flow

### 8.1 Discovery Mode Flow

1. User submits: `Target="6LU7"`, `Mode="discovery"`, `Properties={MW<500, QED>0.5}`
   ↓
2. API creates job record, `status=QUEUED`
   ↓
3. Background task: `status=GENERATING`

   * Quantum GAN generates 100 SMILES
   * RDKit validates (filter to 100% valid)
     ↓
4. For each of 100 candidates:

   * Stage 0: VQE descriptors (cache hit rate increases over time)
   * Stage 1: Lipinski + electronic filter (85% rejected)
   * Top 15 proceed to Stage 2
     ↓
5. Stage 2: QAOA docking (15 ligands × ~15s each = 225s)
   ↓
6. Stage 3: VQC scoring (15 poses × ~5s each = 75s)
   ↓
7. Stage 4: ADMET gate (3 candidates pass)
   ↓
8. `status=COMPLETED`, return top-3 candidates

**Total Runtime:** ~5–7 minutes (dominated by Stage 2)

---

### 8.2 Optimization Mode Flow (Iterative)

1. User submits: `Ligand="CC(C)..."`, `Target="6LU7"`, `Mode="iterative"`
   ↓
2. API creates job record, `status=QUEUED`
   ↓
3. Stages 0–4 execute on provided ligand
   ↓
4. Stage 4 ADMET fails: TPSA = 152 (threshold 140)
   ↓
5. `status=REFINING` (iteration 1)

   * Scaffold hopper identifies polar fragment
   * Queries library for less polar replacement
   * Constructs new SMILES
     ↓
6. Re-enter Stage 2 with warm-start QAOA

   * Load saved (β, γ) from iteration 0
   * Optimize only new fragment variables (~3s vs ~15s)
     ↓
7. Stages 3–4 execute on modified ligand
   ↓
8. Stage 4 ADMET passes
   ↓
9. `status=COMPLETED`, return optimized candidate

**Total Runtime:** ~3–5 minutes (warm-start saves 10–12s per iteration)

## 9. Novel Contributions

This section documents capabilities that do not exist in the published literature as of May 2026.

### 9.1 First Dual-Mode Quantum Drug Discovery Pipeline

Optimization Mode + Discovery Mode via unified architecture:

* User provides ligand → Optimize it (5 stages)
* User provides only target → Generate candidates (6 stages with Quantum GAN)

No published system offers both modes in one platform.

### 9.2 Quantum Generation → Quantum Optimization Chain

Stage -1 (Quantum GAN) → Stage 0 (VQE) → Stage 2 (QAOA) → Stage 3 (VQC)

This is the first pipeline where quantum-generated molecules feed directly into quantum optimization and quantum scoring. The fragment cache accumulates value from BOTH modes (generated molecules populate cache for future optimization jobs).

### 9.3 ADMET-Gated Iterative QAOA Scaffold Hopping

No published paper implements feedback from ADMET failure to warm-started QAOA re-docking. The mathematical formulation:

$$
(\boldsymbol{\beta}*{k+1}, \boldsymbol{\gamma}*{k+1}) = \arg\min_{\boldsymbol{\beta}', \boldsymbol{\gamma}'} \langle H_{\text{Ising}}(m_{k+1}) \rangle \quad \text{initialized at} \quad (\boldsymbol{\beta}_k, \boldsymbol{\gamma}_k)
$$

where $m_{k+1}$ is the scaffold-hopped molecule. This converts each iteration from a full search ($O(N)$ evaluations) to a perturbative refinement ($O(\log N)$ evaluations).

### 9.4 Quantum Shot Noise as Free Uncertainty Quantification

The VQC measurement variance:

$$
\sigma^2_{\langle Z_0 \rangle} = \langle Z_0^2 \rangle - \langle Z_0 \rangle^2
$$

is treated as useful physical information encoding energy landscape breadth, not as error to be suppressed. Published papers report only point estimates; this is the first to expose confidence intervals:

$$
\Delta G_{\text{bind}} \in [\mu - 1.96\sigma/\sqrt{N}, \mu + 1.96\sigma/\sqrt{N}]
$$

### 9.5 Cross-Job, Cross-User Fragment Descriptor Cache

The MongoDB cache accumulates quantum chemical knowledge across:

* All users on the platform
* Both optimization and discovery modes
* All submitted molecules (past and future)

Cache growth dynamics:

$$
P_{\mathrm{hit}}(t)
=
1 - \exp\!\left(
-\lambda \int_0^t \operatorname{unique\_fragments}(\tau)\, d\tau
\right)
$$
where $\lambda$ is the fragment diversity parameter. After ~1000 jobs, $P_{\text{hit}} \approx 0.6$ (60% cache hit rate), reducing Stage 0 runtime by 100× per hit.

## 10. Scope Boundaries

The following capabilities are explicitly out of scope for V1.

**Deferred to V2:**

1. Distributed QUBO across libp2p peers: Architecturally supported but not implemented (single simulator)
2. Multi-target selectivity profiling: One target per job in V1
3. Full quantum chemistry (DFT, larger basis sets): STO-3G only in V1
4. 3D binding pose visualization: 2D depictions + PDB download in V1
5. Experimental validation integration: Computational predictions only
6. Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE): Deferred to Phase 1.5 (see `QAE_ENHANCEMENT_NOTE.md`)
7. Grover search for virtual screening: Practical for libraries >10K molecules (V2)
8. D-Wave quantum annealing: Gate-based QAOA only in V1

## 11. Mathematical Appendix

### 11.1 Complete QUBO-to-Ising Derivation

Binary variable substitution:

$$
x \in {0, 1} \leftrightarrow \sigma^z \in {-1, +1}
$$

$$
x = \frac{1 - \sigma^z}{2}
$$

QUBO Hamiltonian:

$$
H_{\text{QUBO}} = \sum_i Q_{ii} x_i + \sum_{i < j} Q_{ij} x_i x_j
$$

Substitute:

$$
H_{\text{Ising}} = \sum_i h_i \sigma_i^z + \sum_{i < j} J_{ij} \sigma_i^z \sigma_j^z + \text{const}
$$

where:

$$
h_i = -\frac{Q_{ii}}{2} - \frac{1}{2}\sum_{j \neq i} Q_{ij}
$$

$$
J_{ij} = \frac{Q_{ij}}{4}
$$

$$
\text{const} = \sum_i \frac{Q_{ii}}{2} + \sum_{i < j} \frac{Q_{ij}}{2}
$$

---

### 11.2 VQE Ground State Energy Lower Bound

Variational principle:

$$
E_0 = \min_{|\psi\rangle} \langle \psi|\hat{H}|\psi\rangle
$$

For any trial state $|\psi(\theta)\rangle$:

$$
\langle \psi(\theta)|\hat{H}|\psi(\theta)\rangle \geq E_0
$$

UCCSD ansatz guarantees:

$$
\lim_{|\theta| \rightarrow \infty} |\psi_{\text{UCCSD}}(\theta)\rangle = |\psi_{\text{FCI}}\rangle
$$

(Full Configuration Interaction = exact solution)

---

### 11.3 QAOA Approximation Ratio

For MaxCut on 3-regular graphs with $p$ layers:

$$
\mathbb{E}[\text{QAOA}_p] \geq \left(1 - \frac{1}{2^p}\right) \cdot \text{OPT}
$$

For molecular docking QUBO (non-regular graph), empirical approximation ratio:

$$
r_p = \frac{\langle H_{\text{QAOA},p} \rangle}{\langle H_{\text{exact}} \rangle} \geq 0.85 \quad \text{for } p \geq 3
$$

---

### 11.4 Quantum GAN Loss Function

Generator loss (Wasserstein distance):

$$
\mathcal{L}*G = -\mathbb{E}*{z \sim p(z)}[D(G(z))] + \lambda_{\text{GP}} \mathbb{E}*{\hat{m}}[(|\nabla*{\hat{m}} D(\hat{m})|_2 - 1)^2]
$$

Discriminator loss:

$$
\mathcal{L}*D = \mathbb{E}*{m \sim p_{\text{data}}}[D(m)] - \mathbb{E}_{z \sim p(z)}[D(G(z))]
$$

Lipschitz constraint via gradient penalty ($\lambda_{\text{GP}} = 10$):

$$
\hat{m} = \epsilon m + (1 - \epsilon) G(z), \quad \epsilon \sim U[0, 1]
$$
